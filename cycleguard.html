            <h3>CycleGuard</h3>
            <p>CycleGuard is a mobile application and accompnaying helmet that aims to innovate the bike riding experience. The 
            helmet offers various safety features including automatic headlights and brakelights as well as toggleable turn signals. CycleGuard 
            connects to a mobile app to track the userâ€™s history of bike rides, as a gamified fitness tracker system for encouraging users to 
            exercise more. It saves history of bike rides and uses user-input metrics to determine an estimated calories burned over time, and 
            displays this information as easy-to-understand visual graphs. Users are encouraged to bike more through earnable achievements and 
            an in-game currency system, with currency earned based on distance traveled. Currency can then be spent on in-game cosmetics such 
            as background colors. In addition to this the app includes social platforms for users to create accounts and interact with their friends. 
            </p>
            
            <h3>My Experience as a Front End Developer</h3>
            <p>My primary responsibilities on this project took place on the front end. I was responsible for many aesthetic design decisions that 
            aimed to make the app an appealing and intuitive experience for users. This included working directly on the home page where weekly statistics, 
            welcome messages, and achievment progress can be viewed in an engaging and visual manner. I developed the trip history page where users 
            can see their all time statistics and view their entire ride history with a number of filters such as distance rode and the dates rides were completed.
            Again this aimed to have a visually appealing layout that makes users excited to look at their progress. The achievements page where various badges
            and the current progress can be seen, the store where items can be purchased and interacted with in other parts of the app, and the settings where users
            can select themes, darkmode, privacy settings, and icons were all designed by me with the same goals as the major app features.
